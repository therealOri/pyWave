# How To
When you first run pyWave, You will need to make a "deposit". It needs to know/have the whole ammount you want to manage in the database to start with, then you can start using it normally/making transactions. Like say I have 1,000.00 in a safe, I'd make my first transaction using pyWave "in" for 1000 with a description for "Starting Ballance". Then everytime I want to take money out of the safe or add money to the safe, I'd run pyWave and "make a transaction", then I'm good to go.

For example:

> If you have multiple accounts/places you have money, then make a new database and then edit config.json with the new database name and it'll use the new database.
